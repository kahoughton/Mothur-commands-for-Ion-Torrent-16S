# Mothur-commands-for-Ion-Torrent-16S

These commands can be used to process fastq files of 16S rDNA amplicons sequences from the Ion Torrent Platform.
They were written for a project that had samples sequenced on two different sequencing runs. The two fastq files are merged in the initial steps and the output is used for the rest of the commands. 
The original two fastq files are 
    Peri_noecoli.fastq
    TB2_20141030.fastq
The resulting fasta and qual file are named TB1_2
